SELECT player_id, device_id
FROM Activity
WHERE (player_id, device_id, event_date)IN(
  SELECT player_id, device_id, MIN(event_date)
  FROM Activity
  Group BY player_id
)

-----
In subquery, the field name needed to match with the first line of query,
because the MIN(event_date) with GROUP BY player_id will providing more than 1 rows
if not apply fields name in the subquery, the outer query will NOT KNOW which to show
and will give an error
